 * Problem Description
 * The fastfood chain McBurger owns several restaurants along a highway. Recently, they have decided to build several depots along the highway, each one located at a restaurant and supplying several of the restaurants with the needed ingredients. Naturally, these depots should be placed so that the average distance between a restaurant and its assigned depot is minimized. You are to write a program that computes the optimal positions and assignments of the depots.
 *
 * To make this more precise, the management of McBurger has issued the following specification: You will be given the positions of n restaurants along the highway as n integers d1 < d2 < ... < dn (these are the distances measured from the company's headquarter, which happens to be at the same highway). Furthermore, a number k (k <= n) will be given, the number of depots to be built.
 *
 * The k depots will be built at the locations of k different restaurants. Each restaurant will be assigned to the closest depot, from which it will then receive its supplies. To minimize shipping costs, the total distance sum, defined as
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * must be as small as possible.
 *
 * Write a program that computes the positions of the k depots, such that the total distance sum is minimized.
 *  
 *
 *  Input
 *  The input file contains several descriptions of fastfood chains. Each description starts with a line containing the two integers n and k. n and k will satisfy 1 <= n <= 200, 1 <= k <= 30, k <= n. Following this will n lines containing one integer each, giving the positions di of the restaurants, ordered increasingly.
 *
 *  The input file will end with a case starting with n = k = 0. This case should not be processed.
 *   
 *
 *   Output
 *   For each chain, first output the number of the chain. Then output a line containing the total distance sum.
 *
 *   Output a blank line after each test case.
 *    
 *
 *    Sample Input
 *    6 3
 *    5
 *    6
 *    12
 *    19
 *    20
 *    27
 *    0 0
 *     
 *
 *     Sample Output
 *     Chain 1
 *     Total distance sum = 8

 *        thoughts:
 *        dp[i][j] means Min distance [1 : i] resturants has j depot.  
 *        dp[i][j]  = min(dp[k][j-1], + dis[k+1][i])  ( j - 1 < k < i )
 *        dis[i][j] means put 1 depot from  i to j, the distance is ??
 *
 *        Previous issue:
 *        开始认为 dp[i][j] 代表的是选中j为仓库的情况下的最小值，这样认为的原因是没有选对
