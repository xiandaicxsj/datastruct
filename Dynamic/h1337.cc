 * Problem Description
 * A certain prison contains a long hall of n cells, each right next to each other. Each cell has a prisoner in it, and each cell is locked.
 * One night, the jailer gets bored and decides to play a game. For round 1 of the game, he takes a drink of whiskey, and then runs down the hall unlocking each cell. For round 2, he takes a drink of whiskey, and then runs down the hall locking every other cell (cells 2, 4, 6, …). For round 3, he takes a drink of whiskey, and then runs down the hall. He visits every third cell (cells 3, 6, 9, …). If the cell is locked, he unlocks it; if it is unlocked, he locks it. He repeats this for n rounds, takes a final drink, and passes out.
 *
 * Some number of prisoners, possibly zero, realizes that their cells are unlocked and the jailer is incapacitated. They immediately escape.
 *
 * Given the number of cells, determine how many prisoners escape jail.
 *  
 *
